          <p><strong>Project Statement</strong></p>
          <p>
            To match the theme of our exhibition, I return to the fragment of my life where everything is a constant decision that I need to make.
            Decision paralysis comes in a pair with anxiety, and it can paralyze you mentally and physically from making the actions you need to take. 
            Sounds and visuals that evoke this sense of time running out have been compiled into one. 
            Everyone goes through a similar journey and it is up to them to either freeze in time or to accept the fact that they need to make the next move.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Artist Statement</strong></p>
          <p>
            My name is Judy Yang and I am in my last year at Baruch College as a business communications major. My journey as a new media artist was a bit confusing. 
            It wasnâ€™t the traditional route of art making that I was used to. Every class that I took allowed me to realize that I was allowed to do more things and 
            everyone was more open to new perspectives and ideas. Ultimately, I am now able to view things from a different angle and can express ideas in alternate ways.

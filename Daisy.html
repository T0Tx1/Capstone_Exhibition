            Strain is a video that reflects on the things that hold us and the feeling of restraint. In life we are
often stopped from doing many things that we want to do, the reasons are either external or
internal. Why is it that we follow these restraints and don’t try to break through them? Through
different visual representations, the piece shows restraint and looks to show the emotion that
can come from it. This piece hones in on the tense feeling that can come from feeling strained.

          <p><strong>Artist Statement</strong></p>
          <p>
            Taking inspiration from my love of art, in my new media projects I’ve explored different themes
            of self and expression. I’ve used a wide range of media, including the Premiere Pro, Photoshop
            and Animate. My themes largely include self reflection, but through different modes of realism
            and fantasy. Using more visual imagery and messaging to help the audience feel the emotion
            and resonate with the work.

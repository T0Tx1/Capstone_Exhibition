            <p><strong>Project Statement</strong></p>
            <p>
              The subject of gambling extends beyond addiction, encompassing a spectrum of personal experiences, including the thrill of participation and the excitement of prediction. This video project reflects a nuanced perspective on gambling, focusing not solely on its potential harms but also on its appeal and the human desire for risk and reward. Personally, I engage with professional sports betting through online platforms, finding joy in the strategy, anticipation, and connection it brings to the games. This approach broadens the conversation, emphasizing the widespread relatability of gambling as a shared human practice. By presenting an open and honest perspective, the work invites audiences to consider their own connections to risk-taking, enjoyment, and the varied roles gambling plays in society.

            <p><strong>Artist Statement</strong></p>
            <p>
              As a new media artist, I draw from a diverse skill set cultivated during my years as a student, including Photoshop, video editing, and internet design. These tools allow me to explore the intersection of technology and creativity, crafting dynamic visuals and interactive experiences that engage audiences. My work often reflects a deep curiosity about how digital media shapes our perceptions and connections in an increasingly virtual world.

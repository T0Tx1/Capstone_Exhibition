<<<<<<< HEAD
            This project, titled "Fading Sweetness," is a short film that uses the metaphor of chocolate to explore how our desires and emotions evolve over time. The narrative follows a personal reflection on childhood memories of wanting chocolate and the joy it once brought, contrasted with the indifferent satisfaction of easily obtaining it in adulthood. The goal is to evoke a sense of nostalgia and loss, resonating with anyone who has experienced the fading of simple pleasures as they grow up. Through visuals, music, and reflective narration, the film aims to connect personal memories with universal themes of change and the passage of time.

          <p><strong>Artist Statement</strong></p>
          <p>
            I am deeply interested in the intersection between memory and the passage of time. I desire to capture fleeting moments and explore how they shape our self-understanding. I aim to create immersive experiences that encourage viewers to reflect on their own histories and emotional landscapes, drawing connections between personal and universal experiences.

          <p><strong>Project Statement</strong></p>
          <p>
            My project is an exploration of the concept of being present in the moment, emphasizing the contrast between different environments and the unique feelings they evoke. Being present in the space highlights the way different locations shape our experience of time and space. By comparing the fast-paced energy of urban life with the calm of rural settings, I reflect on how each environment provides distinct emotional responses. While the city offers a dynamic rhythm that I enjoy, there are moments when I seek peace in quieter spaces, where I can truly be present. This project invites viewers to consider how the pace of life affects their own connection to the moment, encouraging mindfulness and appreciation for the fleeting nature of time.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Artist Statement</strong></p>
          <p>
            Through my work, I share a desire to embrace the current moment. The works explore the importance of taking in the present moment and cherishing it. I aim to inspire others to experience life as it unfolds, savoring being present in the moment regardless of thinking past or future. In past works, such as Toast’s Daily, I used fluid, hand-drawn animation to capture fleeting emotions tied to a specific moment. Through CC’s Journey, I employed generative coding techniques to craft ever-evolving visual patterns, reflecting the essence of places and times I’ve experienced. These mediums allow me to convey the richness of each moment, drawing attention to the beauty of the ordinary and the extraordinary. With that, I hope is that viewers of my work feel inspired to slow down, reflect, and fully engage with the present moment.

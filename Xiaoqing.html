          <p><strong>Project Statement</strong></p>
          <p>
            "Follow Your Mind" is a photography-based project designed to inspire individuals to focus on
their true desires and aspirations, rather than conforming to societal expectations of what defines
a “good life.” Through a series of digital collage photographs, this project reflects my personal
passions and encourages viewers to break free from external pressures. By emphasizing themes
of self-discovery and individuality, "Follow Your Mind" seeks to remind people of the
importance of listening to their inner voice and carving their own unique path in life.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Artist Statement</strong></p>
          <p>
            As a new media practitioner, I strive to explore the delicate balance between external influences
            and inner desires. Through my work, including animations on themes like sustainable clothing,
            the story of a sunny doll, and the journey of an orange figure, I aim to connect with audiences on
            a personal level. My practice also extends to creating humorous and lighthearted videos, using
            humor as a way to reflect on life’s complexities. In my project Follow Your Mind, I delve into the
            importance of listening to your inner voice amidst the noise of societal expectations and external
            judgments. This piece embodies the idea of seeking clarity within oneself, embracing
            individuality, and pursuing what genuinely resonates with your passions and values.

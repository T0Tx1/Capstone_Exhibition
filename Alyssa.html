          <p><strong>Project Statement</strong></p>
          <p>
            This project is a personal statement on identity, how it affects me, and how I grew from
            thinking I wasn’t “Latina” enough due to stereotypes or the lack of fluency in my language. My
            main goal would be to show that Latinas don't come in one way, we come in all different shapes
            and colors and we don’t need to conform to stereotypes.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Artist Statement</strong></p>
          <p>
            As a Latin-American artist, specifically Salvadoran-American, I always felt my identity
            being questioned. Whether that would be not speaking Spanish fluently or not “looking the part”
            based on modern stereotypes, I find myself going back and forth between being American versus
            being Salvadoran.
            Through my art, I want to showcase that there is no singular Latina identity and everyone
            comes in different shapes and colors. My work expresses my journey to reclaim my identity
            beyond stereotypes, labels, and expectations. I showcase my work to others that when feeling
            disconnected or “not enough”, it is okay and it’s time to redefine that space on what it means to
            belong

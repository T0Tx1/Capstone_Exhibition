          <p><strong>Project Statement</strong></p>
          <p>
            My project delves into the impact of societal and family pressures on the mental health of young
women, focusing on the experience of a college student grappling with stress and anxiety.
Drawing inspiration from the interplay between parental expectations, social dynamics, and
cultural norms, the work explores how these pressures contribute to self-doubt, heightened stress,
and the potential for severe mental health challenges like depression. Through this project, I aim
to shed light on individuals’ struggles in high-pressure environments and advocate for a culture
prioritizing empathy, self-acceptance, and mental well-being over unattainable standards and
external validation.

          <p><strong>Artist Statement</strong></p>
          <p>
            In my new media projects, I have explored stress, and societal expectations impact young college
            students. My work spans diverse mediums, including a responsive website on Washington, DC
            travel, designed with wireframes and built using HTML and CSS for seamless navigation. In
            animation, I’ve tackled issues like urban littering and its harmful effects on animals and the
            environment, creating projects to inspire awareness and action. Each project aims to inform,
            engage, and inspire action on important topics. Through these works, I aim to merge creativity
            and technology to engage audiences and address meaningful issues.

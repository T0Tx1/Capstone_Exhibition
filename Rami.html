          <p><strong>Project Statement</strong></p>
          <p>
            My piece, PRIDE, is about being yourself and accepting who you are in a
            world that pressures individuals to conform, making us feel outcasted from the rest of the world.
            I want everyone to feel empowered in their own journey of self-discovery and acceptance,
            regardless of the path they take. It's all about living in the moment as who you are, and not who
            others want you to be.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Artist Statement</strong></p>
          <p>
            For my piece, I decided to take images of queer people who are big in current
mainstream media, and who have impacted my journey significantly, as well as being
unapologetically themselves 100% of the time. These people helped me in my journey of
discovering who I was and knowing I wasn't alone.

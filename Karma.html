          <p><strong>Project Statement</strong></p>
          <p>
            Home is a multidisciplinary project that reflects my ongoing exploration of how movement through landscapes fosters a sense of belonging and reshapes our understanding of identity. Inspired by my upbringing in Nepal, where the mountains and trekking culture were integral to daily life, this project draws parallels between my personal history and my experiences in new environments.
The work incorporates photographs from Manang, Nepal, and visual media from the Rocky Mountains of Colorado—two landscapes that hold deep emotional significance for me. These places highlight how walking through and engaging with physical spaces can create emotional ties, transforming unfamiliar terrain into something meaningful and familiar.
Through Home, I share a personal narrative of connection, inviting viewers to reflect on their own journeys and consider how the landscapes they move through shape their evolving sense of home.

          <p><strong>Artist Statement</strong></p>
          <p>
            As a new media artist, my work explores the interplay between physical landscapes and emotional connections, focusing on how movement through spaces, such as hiking, fosters a sense of belonging and identity. Growing up in Nepal, my relationship with the mountains was both personal and cultural, shaped by my family’s reliance on tourism in Manang. This upbringing instilled in me a deep appreciation for the transformative power of journeys.
Using photography and video, I document my experiences of moving through landscapes to understand how these journeys shape our concept of home. My practice is rooted in storytelling, capturing moments that evoke reflection and connection, and inviting viewers to consider their own ties to place and identity. Whether working with familiar environments or exploring new terrain, I aim to reveal how physical movement reshapes our emotional landscapes and creates new ways of belonging.
